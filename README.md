# What is ctylab.com
Ctylab is a community driven framework developed step-by-step, with groups of dedicated citizens, civil servants and entrepreneurs, that search for new ways to create value in a local context. Think of the sharing economy, crowd-funding, energy microgrids, participative democracy, local IoT data, municipal bonds and more. 

The platform helps citizengroups stay flexible, informal, trustworthy and spontaneous. It takes away the burdens of organization, financial payoffs, formal agreements, datasharing (and ownership), digital communication and marketing of ideas and events. Our goal is to let citizens share a common ground online, so that ideas, projects, funding and events reach the right people faster and more efficient. 

In recent years we've seen many civil apps fail because they have not been able to build enough local communities. Simple local solutions for wayfinding, social meeting, bicycle sharing, neighbor alerts, recycling stuff, just to name some. Each small solution requires users to sign-in, connect and get familiar with the UI. Each app targeted the same groups. Each app started with zero users and failed to get momentum. Something needed to be done.    

As Ctylab grows. We allow developers to use our SDK and attach their (preferably blockchain based) civil solutions to the framework. Ctylab will be your prefered solution since it offers local community users and additional opportunities to profit from your work.  

Ctylab is born in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. He is 1 year old, and for now only speaks Dutch (but he's a fast learner).
